<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
Element84 is a woman-owned software company located in Alexandria, Virginia, specializing in developing end-to-end geospatial data processing pipelines and software solutions for clients aiming to better the planet. Element84 works with public, private, and non-profit clients to bring their projects to life.

<h2>Strengths</h2>
<div class="grid two-col">
<div class="card">
<h3>1. Clear Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
Upon opening the homepage, the mission statement “We develop impactful end-to-end geospatial data processing pipelines and software solutions for clients who want to improve our planet” is one of the first things users see.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2. Structured Content</h3>
<p>
The content on the homepage (Our projects, tooling, and research) is clearly labeled and lets users know what exactly they’re getting into.
Subheadings on the Projects page tell users exactly what element84 contributed to a specific project.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>3. Clear Navigation</h3>
<p>
The menu/Site Map allows users to navigate to different pages within the site.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>4. Visual Elements</h3>
<p>
The color palette is fitting. It’s sleek and minimalistic, and the accent color effectively draws the eye to important parts of the page.  
The images used (such as the maps and satellite imagery) are on-brand for the geospatial data processing mission.
</p>

<h2>Pain Points</h2>
<div class="grid two-col">
<div class="card">
<h3>1. Content Rich Homepage</h3>
<p>
The homepage has a lot of content. It can be overwhelming for users when they first enter the site and try to figure out where everything is.
Some of the call-to-actions could be more distinct. For example, the “Career Opportunities” section of the homepage is easily missed because it doesn’t stand out as necessary. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2. Unclear Audience</h3>
<p>
It was a bit unclear to me who the target audience/persona is. A lot of the language is very technical, so it makes me wonder if the audience is peers within the geospatial data industry.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3> 3. Client Perspective</h3>
<p>
It’s not necessarily a pain point; however, I believe having a client testimonials page/section would be beneficial.
Including this section would allow users to read honest reviews from clients who have worked with Element84 and can attest to its quality.
</p>

<h2>Recommendations</h2>
<div class="grid two-col">
<div class="card">
<h3>1. Audience-Specific Landing Pages </h3>
<p>
Having specific sections for different audiences (ie, clients, research, careers, etc.) can make it easier for users to find exactly what they need.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2. Client Quotes</h3>
<p>
<li>Adding a client testimonials section would benefit users by showing that Element84 is helping real people.</li>
Add as a card carousel.
Add numbers, statistics, screenshots, etc.
<div class="card">
<h3>3. Reduce Homepage Content</h3>
<p>
Reduce the amount of content on the homepage or section it off so users aren’t overwhelmed upon first entry.
Make call to actions clearer or distinctive.
