<h2>Strengths</h2>
<div class="grid two-col">
<div class="card">
<h3>1. Clear Mission Statement</h3>
<p>
Upon opening the homepage, the mission statement “We develop impactful end-to-end geospatial data processing pipelines and software solutions for clients who want to improve our planet” is one of the first things users see.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2. Structured Content</h3>
<ul>
<li> The content on the homepage (Our projects, tooling, and research) is clearly labeled and lets users know what exactly they’re getting into. </li>
<li> Subheadings on the Projects page tell users exactly what Element84 contributed to a specific project. </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>3. Clear Navigation</h3>
<p>
The Menu/Site Map allows users to navigate to different pages within the site.
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>4. Visual Elements</h3>
<ul>
<li>The color palette is fitting. It’s sleek and minimalistic, and the accent color effectively draws the eye to important parts of the page. </li>
<li> The images used (such as the maps and satellite imagery) are on-brand for the geospatial data processing mission. </li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<h2>Pain Points</h2>
<div class="grid two-col">
<div class="card">
<h3>1. Content Rich Homepage</h3>
<p>
The homepage has a lot of content. It can be overwhelming for users when they first enter the site and try to figure out where everything is.
Some of the call-to-actions could be more distinct. For example, the “Career Opportunities” section of the homepage is easily missed because it doesn’t stand out as necessary. 
</p>
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3>2. Unclear Audience</h3>
<p>
It was a bit unclear to me who the target audience/persona is. A lot of the language is very technical, so it makes me wonder if the audience is peers within the geospatial data industry.
</div>
<div class="card">
<h3> 3. Client Perspective</h3>
<p>
It’s not necessarily a pain point; however, I believe having a client testimonials page/section would be beneficial.
Including this section would allow users to read honest reviews from clients who have worked with Element84 and can attest to its quality.

  <h2>Recommendations</h2>
  <div class="grid">

    <div class="card">
      <h3>1. Audience-Specific Landing Pages</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Having specific sections for different audiences (ie, clients, research, careers, etc.) can make it easier for users to find exactly what they need.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>2. Client Quotes</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Adding a client testimonials section would benefit users by showing that Element84 is helping real people.</li>
        <li>Add numbers, statistics, screenshots, etc.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="card">
      <h3>3. Reduce Homepage Content</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduce the amount of content on the homepage or section it off so users aren’t overwhelmed upon first entry.</li>
        <li>Make call-to-actions clearer or distinctive.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

<h2> PURE Analysis</h2>
<img src="pure.png" alt="Pure Analysis of Element84" class="pure-image"> 
<div class="card">
<p> 
<strong> PURE Test I performed through three happy task paths on Element84. </strong>

<p> First, I went to the homepage, which required no cognitive effort because it opens automatically when users visit the site. I then had to find career opportunities by scrolling down the homepage, which took a bit of brain power. After that, locating the sign-up for job alerts tab was easy since it was on the career opportunities landing page. Finally, inputting my contact information was the last step, which took a bit of cognitive effort but not much since it’s information I am familiar with. </p>

Next, I went to the homepage, located ux and design, connected with UX experts, and input my contact information. The homepage required the same amount of cognitive effort as the first test. Locating UX and design, and connecting with UX experts, also took the same amount of cognitive effort, since I had to scroll through the site for both to find them. Inputting my contact information was the same amount of cognitive load.

<p> Lastly, I went to the homepage, clicked on "Contact Us," and input my information. Finding the contact us page required less cognitive effort since I had seen it in my previous attempts. However, it may take some time for a first-time user. Inputting the contact information was the same amount of cognitive effort as in the last tests.
